{"name":"SEDA","tagline":"Simultaneous Environment Discovery & Annotation","body":"### What is SEDA?\r\n\r\nSEDA is a project for enhancing human learning by using state of the art techniques from computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, and augmented reality. The non-technically constrained goal is to create an overlay to human vision to help with tasks humans are inherently bad at such as memory, calculations, and abstractions and to help speed up tasks such as looking up information and referencing material.\r\n\r\n### Computer Vision Component Of SEDA\r\n\r\nVP: [Paul Schroeder](@CattleProdigy)\r\n\r\n[Repository](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/SEDA-CV-TextDetection)\r\n\r\n[Vagrant Configuration](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/SEDA-CV-TextDetection-vagrant-config)\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning Component of SEDA\r\n\r\nVP: [Hobey Kuhn](@hkuhn)\r\n\r\n[Repository](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/SEDA-ML-Summarization)\r\n\r\n[Vagrant Configuration](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/SEDA-ML-Summarization-vagrant-config)\r\n\r\n### Augmented Reality Component of SEDA\r\n\r\nVP: [Daniel DeTone](@ddetone)\r\n\r\n[Repository](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/AR-TextAnnotation)\r\n\r\n[Vagrant Configuration](https://github.com/S-E-D-A/AR-TextAnnotation-vagrant-config)","google":"UA-44200404-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
